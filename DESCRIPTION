Description: An R interface to V8: Google's open source JavaScript and WebAssembly 
    engine. This package can be compiled either with V8 version 6 and up, a NodeJS
    shared library, or the legacy 3.14/3.15 branch of V8.

SystemRequirements: V8 engine version 6+ is needed for modern JS and WASM support. On 
    Debian / Ubuntu install either libv8-dev or libnode-dev, on Fedora use v8-devel. 
    The readme has instructions for installing backports on Ubuntu Xenial and Bionic. 
    It is still possible to build this package against the legacy libv8 version 3.14
    branch, but these engines only support traditional JavaScript (ES5).
