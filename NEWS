 - Fix getRversion() type requested by CRAN

4.3.0
 - MacOS: update libv8 to 11.2
 - Windows: use libv8 version 9.1 on all R >= 4.0, drop support for Win2008/Vista
 - Add feature test for V8_ENABLE_SANDBOX, required by some V8 10.8+ (#144)

4.2.2
 - Fix a sanitizer error by avoiding a broken API on NodeJS (#152)
 - You can override build flags by setting V8_PKG_LIBS / V8_PKG_CFLAGS

4.2.1
 - Fix a feature test for NodeJS 18 (#145)

4.2.0
 - Use CXX17 on supported platforms. C++17 is required as of libv8 10.2

4.1.0
 - engine_info() now includes a 'numeric_version' field for easy comparison
 - make js-to-r callback mechanism robust against -DRCPP_USE_UNWIND_PROTECT

4.0.0
 - If a call to ct$eval(),ct$get(), or ct$call() returns a JavaScript promise,
   you can set await = TRUE to wait for the promise to be resolved. It will
   then return the result of the promise, or an error in case the promise is
   rejected.
 - New section about promises in the intro vignette.
 - New function wasm_features() lists the supported WASM capabilities on the
   current installation.
 - Updated static libv8 for Mac and Linux to v8-v8-9.6.180.12
 - Windows ucrt: update libv8 to 9.1.269.38
 - Legacy libv8 versions (3.xx) are no longer supported. Package will still
   build but the examples and vignette now assume support for promises.
 - On Ubuntu, RHEL, and MacOS we now default to DOWNLOAD_STATIC_LIBV8=1 for
   supported architectures (amd64 and arm64). If this fails it will fall back
   on finding a local libv8. Opt-out by setting DISABLE_STATIC_LIBV8=1.

3.6.0
 - Try to give better error message when unable to allocate, probably due to
   hitting the stack limit. Previously we would see 'string conversion failed'
   which was very confusing.
 - The same stacklimit is now used across all platforms. Previously we would only
   set it on Linux, but apparently it is also needed on Windows sometimes.
 - Disable stacklimit when running in ASAN (which blows up the stack size)
 - Make DOWNLOAD_STATIC_LIBV8 the default on RHEL/CentOS based distros because
   these include a very old or no libv8.
 - Check and warn against very old libv8 when attaching the package.

3.5.0
 - On legacy systems which still have libv8 version 3.x we now try to download
   a more recent static libv8. We plan to deprecate support for libv8 3.x, which
   is now over 10 years old, and does not support ES6 (modern JavaScript).

3.4.2
 - Add Windows binaries for ucrt targets

3.4.1
 - Minor compatibility fixes by Jan Marvin for new versions of libv8.

3.4.0
 - When setting envvar DOWNLOAD_STATIC_LIBV8=1 on Linux at build-time, the
   configure script automatically downloads a static libv8, instead of looking
   for libv8 on the system. This allows the package to be installed on distros
   that do not have libv8, or ship with a very old V8.
 - The above should work for all x86_64 Linux systems with at least gcc-4.8.5
   and is enabled by default on Travis and Github Actions.
 - Do not assume bash in configure script

3.3.1
 - Fix a bug in the configure script

3.3.0
 - Use CXX14 when available, required as of libv8 version 8.7.80

 - Add FatalErrorHandler and MessageListener callbacks (that just print stuff)
 - Fix UBSAN error during teardown (package unload)

3.1.0
 - Fix configure script for pointer compression in upcoming V8 engine 8.4
 - MacOS: binary packagess now ship with V8 engine 8.3

3.0.2
 - Windows: fix text encoding bug introduced in 3.0 for non-ascii text.
 - Fix unit test for big-endian systems

   officially provides and symlinks libv8-dev.
 - Fix build for new V8 7.3.492.22 (Jan Marvin, #55)

2.0
 - Major upgrade: now support libv8 version 6.x and up. Note that this means
   we move to ES2015+ adding support for promises, async, etc. This may change
   the behavior of certain JavaScript libraries.
 - For now we also still stupport building with legacy V8 (3.14)
 - Debian Buster: support building with libnode-dev
 - Fedora: support building with v8-devel (V8 6.7.17)
 - MacOS: update binary package to V8 7.2.502.24
